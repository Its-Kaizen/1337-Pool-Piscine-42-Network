## üèä EXPLAINING THE POOL

It's pretty straightforward. You get a month, divided into four weeks. During this time, you'll work on different projects that help you improve your coding skills and get a handle on concepts like loops, pointers, dealing with information, and basic memory stuff (nothing too complicated). Expect a test every Friday, four in total. just make sure you solve at least two exercises for each.

## üó∫Ô∏è EDUCATION SYSTEM (Holy Graph)

</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.ibb.co/cvtZG8k/holy-graph.png" width="800">
</p>

When you're a student, you'll work on a bunch of projects called common core. How long it takes depends on how fast you're learning. Each time you finish a project, you earn extra time to stay in the program and avoid getting into the BLACKHOLE ! , Once you're done with the common core, you look for an internship. After that, you can decide if you want to keep studying and go deeper into advanced stuff at school or start working.

## üåå BLACKHOLE MEANING

</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/54/ee/5c/54ee5cd32e3a6991e3271c0b23b22bb0.gif" width="800">
</p>

The blackhole is a system that motivates students to stay active and not get lazy with their projects. It's kind of like a game. The more projects you finish and get approved, the longer you can stay in school. But if you don't finish projects and just stay lazy, you'll use up all your chances and get kicked out of school forever.
